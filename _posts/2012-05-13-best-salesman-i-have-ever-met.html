  It’s a hot summer afternoon.
  I am in a bus travelling from Hyderabad, my workplace, to Khammam, my hometown.
  It’s an unplanned journey needing me to reach the destination as soon as possible.
  This haste made me go for a non-a/c bus.
</p>

<p>
  Three hours of journey has passed and I’m regretting for taking a non-a/c bus, for it is 39°C outside.
  Several vendors stormed into the bus when it halted at Suryapet bus station.
  It appeared as if my laments have been addressed, when I saw a vendor pacing towards me with cool water bottles.
  He was quick and passed me by the time I reacted to call for one bottle.
  I called him.
  My voice was gloomed by his loud shout out:
  <span class='blockquote'>
    Water bottles, cool drinks.
  </span>
  With some effort, I could manage to grab his attention.
  I wasn’t much pleased looking at the water bottles as he approached, for what’s written on them was shady.
  It’s only when I read...
  <span class='blockquote'>
    <i>AquaSin</i> - India’s No. 1 brand for 100% pure water.
  </span>
  ...did I realise that I am utterly underexposed to the top brands in India.
  The falsified brand water was ridiculously overpriced and I refused to purchase it.
  So, did several people in the bus.
</p>

<p>
  I was hoping to find another vendor with authentic waterbottles.
  A vendor shuffled in with a basket in his hand.
  <i>"Hot boiled peanuts"</i> he shouted out packing a handful of peanuts in a piece of paper.
  That would be the last thing anyone would have in such a hot temperature.
  It’s very clear that none in the bus is going to buy that.
  <i>We boil peanuts</i> he shouted.
  <i>Then we add spice to it</i> he continued.
  <i>Then we sell</i> he said <i>packed in papers</i> with a wide grin on his face.
  Half the crowd in the bus broke into giggles.
  <span class='blockquote'>
    Ah! What can we do, we do not have a production plant like the one Haldiram’s has!
  </span>
  Now almost everyone in the bus is laughing and is attentive to what he’s speaking.
  He continued on similar lines, interacting with everyone in a humorous way.
</p>

<p>
  When he approached me, I refused with revered opinion, hinting that I don’t eat street food.
  He said <i>You people do jobs all day and night. Why don’t you enjoy when you can</i> with a grin that’s getting wider with time.
  I couldn’t refuse to have his offering.
  In fact I had two helpings!
</p>

<p>
  I was musing about his sales skills while having the peanuts.
  He didn’t have a great product.
  The market is least interested in his product.
  He nailed the sale, in spite of these negatives, with his expertise in one skill.
  A skill which I thought isn’t very important is sale: <em>humor</em>.
  He entered into a wrong market with a wrong product; made half the customers smile; made sales with all the customers!
  He has chutzpah!!
</p>

<p>
  I have spent the next few minutes nibbling the peanuts cogitating over the salesman’s skill.
  I was preoccupied with these thoughts till I felt thirst.
  I was having oil heavy food on such a hot afternoon.
  Now I need to quench my thirst.
  Where is that <em>AquaSin</em> guy?
