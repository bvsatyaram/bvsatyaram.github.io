<p class="lead">
  The series 2, 4, 8, could obviously be followed by 16, but also by 10 or even 7004.

  It's  always possible to find a rule, a justification which allows a series  to be continued by any number.
  It all depends on how complicated the  rule is.
  So, any number can follow any series.
